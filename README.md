# Node project template

A simple node project template. This can be used as a starting point for
libraries or projects depending on OpenLayers where the following is already
preconfigured:

* testing using karma on es6 modules, optionally with coverage
* webpack to produce optimized and debug builds
* jsdoc for API documentation
* autogenerated examples from a template, including highlighted source code

## Useful commands

Install dependencies

    npm install

Run unit tests

    npm test

Build everything (outputs will live in `build/`-directory)

    npm run build

Start development server with hot reloading (open `http://0.0.0.0:4809/` and find your way through the directory listing)

    npm start
